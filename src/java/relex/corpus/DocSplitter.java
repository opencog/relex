/**
 * DocSplitter -- split document into sentences.
 * Sentences are blocks of text ending with a period, exclamation
 * mark, or question mark. Unpunctuated blocks of text are not
 * recognized as sentences.
 *
 * This class can operate in one of two modes: batch mode and fifo mode.
 *
 * In batch mode, a large block of text is submitted, and the
 * process() or split() methods are used to get arrays of sentences.
 *
 * In fifo mode, it can be fed anything from large blocks of text
 * to sentence fragments or even a few letters at a time, via the
 * addText() method. It can then be polled to see if there is a
 * complete sentence yet, by calling getNextSentence().  Calls
 * to each of these routines can be arbitrarily alternated, with
 * sentence fragments buffered up.
