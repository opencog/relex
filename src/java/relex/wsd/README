This directory implements a simple word-sense disambiguation algorithm.
The current algorithm functions entirely by examing the syntactic
and semantic-relation structure of the sentence.  This approach is
both simple (does not require a large corpus, or training), and
error-prone.  It is sufficient for telling apart word senses in 
simple sentences, but fails when common-sense or cognition is required.

Examples where this algorithm works well:
-----------------------------------------
The word "fishing" in:

	"I was fishing for an answer.", "We went on a fishing expedition."

These are two different parts of speech (a gerund, a noun modifier)
and thus are not the same sense of the word "fishing".

	"I was fishing for an answer.", "We went fishing for trout."

The part of speech matches (both are gerunds), and the sentence
structure is identical.  The algorithm declares a match.

	"We went on a fishing expedition.", "I got seasick on the fishing vessel."

The part of speech matches (both are noun modifiers), and the phrase
structure of the phrase containing "fishing" is identical.  The
algorithm declares a match.


Examples where this algorithm fails:
------------------------------------
The word "bark" in:

	"The loud bark woke us up.", "The rough tree bark cut my finger."

The part-of-speech matches, and the sentence structure matches.
The algorithm declares a match, even though clearly two different
senses are involved. 

	"The loud bark woke us up.", "I heard a bark in the distance."

The sentence structure is too dis-similar for the algorithm to detect
that these two ahve the same sense.
