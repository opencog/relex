                         ----------------

Key ideas: 
 * Lexis is the basis of language.
 * Language consists of grammaticalized lexis, not lexicalized grammar.

See: Olga Moudraia, "Lexical Approach to Second Language Teaching"
http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0102lexical.html

Alternate names: "gambits", "lexical phrases", "lexical units", 
"lexicalized stems", "speech formulae".


Definition of Lexical Chunks
----------------------------
Lexis may be single words, and also the word combinations that are a
basis of one's mental lexicon.  That is, language consists of meaningful
chunks that, when combined, produce continuous coherent text; only a
minority of spoken sentences are entirely novel creations.

Types of lexical chunks:
    * Words (e.g., book, pen)
    * Polywords (e.g., by the way, upside down)
    * Collocations, or word partnerships (e.g., community service,
      absolutely convinced)
    * Institutionalized utterances (e.g., I'll get it; We'll see; 
      That'll do; If I were you . . .; Would you like a cup of coffee?)
    * Sentence frames and heads (e.g., That is not as . . . as you think;
      The fact/suggestion/problem/danger was . . .) and even text frames 
      (e.g., In this paper we explore . . .; Firstly . . .; Secondly . . .;
      Finally . . .)

approach." In J. Coady & T.  Huckin (Eds.), "Second language vocabulary 
acquisition: A rationale for pedagogy" (pp.  255-270). Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press.)

The code in this directory can be used to obtain polywords and sentence
frames.  Three distinct mechanisms are encoded in this directory.

LexicalChunker -- abstract base class providing the interface for
     several alternate chunking routines.

PhraseChunker -- print out phrases identified via the classical tree-bank
     style phrase tree.

RelationChunker -- print out phrases based on the binary RelEx relations 
     -- e.g. object phraes, noun modifier phrases, prepositional phrases, etc.

PatternChunker() -- print out lexical chunks based on matching to a 
     collection of sentence patterns. The rest of this README file is
     concerned wth these sentence patterns.


Unit tests
----------

Sentence phrases
----------------
 * John Dillinger was a man who BROKE THE LAW.
   Desired answer: "broke the law"

      (S (NP John Dillinger) (VP was (NP (NP a man) (SBAR (WHNP who) (S (VP broke (NP the law)))))) .)

 * I'll DO it even IF IT KILLS me.
   Desired answer: "do ... if it kills"
      (SBAR if (S (NP it) (VP kills (NP me))))

   This is tricky, because the "do" will be embedded
   in a wide variety of phrase forms.

   XXX this is currently not deteted.


Verb phrases:
------------
Most of these are phrasal verbs of one sort or another.

 * General Custer gave the Sioux chief no quarter.
   The desired answer is "give ... no quarter". 

      (VP gave (NP the Sioux chief) (NP no quarter)) 

   Skip first NP, keep second.

 * Prepositional verbs are phrasal verbs that contain a preposition,
   which is always followed by its nominal object.  The verb has its
   own object, which usually precedes the preposition:

   I TOOK her TO the dance.
   Desired answer: "took ... to"

      (VP took (NP her) (PP to (NP the dance)))

   Skip both NP's, to get "took ... to"
      (VP a (NP r) (PP a (NP r)))

   Similarly, but more complex: 
   She HELPED the boy TO an extra portion of potatoes.

      (VP helped (NP the boy) (PP to (NP (NP an extra portion) (PP of (NP potatoes)))))
      (VP a (NP r) (PP a (NP (NP r) (PP r (NP r)))))
      (VP a (NP r) (PP a (NP *)))

   So we use a * here for the general case.

 * He had A GOOD FEELING FOR that sort of thing.
   Desired answer: "a good feeling for"

      (VP had (NP a good feeling) (PP for (NP that sort of (NP thing))))

 * Phrasal verbs: prepositional verb: 
   He will TAKE OFFICE ON monday.
   Desired answer: "take office on"

      (VP will (VP take office (PP on (NP Monday))))

   need to drop NP in PP, to get "take office on"
   Similarly: (VP was (VP filled (PP to (NP overflowing))))
   (VP look (PP after (NP them))), want "look after".

 * Phrasal verb -- particle verb
   The cup was FILLED TO overflowing.
     (VP was (VP filled (PP to (S (VP overflowing)))))

 * Prepositional verbs with two prepositions:
   We TALKED TO the minister ABOUT the crisis.
      (VP talked (PP to (NP the minister)) (PP about (NP the crisis)))
   so:
      (VP a (PP a (NP r)) (PP a (NP r)))
 
   However, problems when the verb is a copula:
   I was IN LOVE WITH that bunny.
   Desired answer: "in love with"

      (VP was (PP in (NP love)) (PP with (NP that bunny)))
      (VP notcop (PP a (NP postcop)) (PP a (NP r)))

   Drop leading VP, keep first NP, drop second NP.
   (drop first VP because its a copula!)

 * Prepositional verbs with two prepositions:
   I RAN AWAY FROM home.
   I RAN AWAY FROM home at age two.
   Desired answer: "ran away from"

      (VP ran (PP away) (PP from (NP home)))
      (VP ran (PP away) (PP from (NP home)) (PP at (NP age two)))

   Keep the VP, and the first PP, and the second PP, 
   dropping NP in the second PP.
      (VP a (PP a) (PP a (NP r)) *)

 * It was A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW.

      (VP was (NP a bitter pill) (S (VP to (VP swallow))))

   However, this also reports:
     She forced him to resign.
     (VP forced (NP him_1) (S (VP to (VP resign))))
     Phrase: (him to resign)      Character ranges: [11-24]
   -- so this needs modification; perhaps we should drop the final VP?

 * I didn't HAVE THE HEART TO tell hem.
      (VP didn't (VP have (NP the heart) (S (VP to (VP tell (NP him))))))


 * Phrasal verbs -- Particle verbs.
   Intransitive particle verbs do not have an object:

   He WENT AWAY.  I want to GO HOME now. 
      (VP went (PRT away)) 
      (S (VP to (VP go (PRT home))))
      (S (VP to (VP go (PRT home) (PP now))))
      (S (VP Please (VP go (PRT away) (PP now))) .)

   This should cover it:
      (VP a (PRT a) *)
      (S (VP to (VP go (PRT home) *)))

  * Transitive particle verbs have an object, which may preceed 
    the verb:
   SWITCH the light OFF.
      (VP Switch (NP the light) (PRT off))
   so:
      (VP a (NP p) (PRT a))

   "p" flag -- if the NP is a pronoun, we want to keep it!

   Let's GET IT OUT.
   Let's GET IT OUT in the open.
   Let's GET IT OUT in the open now.
	Let's PUT IT ON.

      (VP get (NP it) (PRT out))
      (VP get (NP it) (PRT out) (PP in (NP the open)))
      (VP get (NP it) (PRT out) (PP in (NP the open)) (PP now))

   The obvious pattern is (VP a (NP a) (PRT a) *) but this won't work
   with RelEx, because earlier stages mangle the sentence. The actual
   phrase becomes:
       (VP let's (VP get out (NP it) (PRT) (PP in (NP the open))))
   because the K link was used to merge "get" and "out". This, 
   ahem, wrecks the pattern matching. -- Fixed, had to hack 
   algs/TwoWordCombineToLeftAlg.java to not merge the orig_str.

   We want to keep the object NP only if its a pronoun !!


Noun phrases:
-------------
 * I ate a wee bit of cheese.
   Desired answer: "a wee bit of"

       (NP (NP a wee bit) (PP of (NP cheese)))

   Drop NP after PP.
   a helping of, a hail of, a finger in

 * It is a day's march from home.
   Desired: "a day's march"

       (NP (NP (NP a day 's) march) (PP from (NP home)))

   Rule: three NP's are too deep.
   Otherwise, same as "a wee bit of cheese".

 * It is a couple of clicks down the road.
   Desired: "a couple of"

       (NP (NP a couple) (PP of (NP clicks)))

---------------

It's a good bet he did it.
(S (S (NP It) (VP 's (NP (NP a good bet) (SBAR (S (NP he) (VP did)))))) it .)

It's a good bet that he did it. 

Fails to parse. 


Pattern match:
--------------
a == accept, r == reject
(NP (NP a) (PP a (NP r)))   -- (NP (NP a couple) (PP of (NP clicks)))  -- a couple of
                            -- (NP (NP a wee bit) (PP of (NP cheese))) -- a wee bit of
(NP (NP (NP a) a) (PP r (NP r))) -- (NP (NP (NP a day 's) march) (PP from (NP home))) --  a day's march


(VP a (PP a (NP r)))        -- (VP take office (PP on (NP Monday)))            -- take office on
(VP a (VP a (PP a (NP r)))) -- (VP was (VP filled (PP to (NP overflowing)))) -- was filled to
(VP a (VP a (PP a (S (VP r))))) -- (VP was (VP filled (PP to (S (VP overflowing)))))-- was filled to
(VP a (NP r) (NP a))        -- (VP gave (NP the Sioux chief) (NP no quarter))  -- give ... no quarter.
(VP a (NP r) (PP a (NP *))) -- (VP took (NP her) (PP to (NP the dance)))       -- took ... to

(VP r (NP a) (S (VP a (VP r))))    -- (VP was (NP a bitter pill) (S (VP to (VP swallow)))) -- a bitter pill to

(VP r (VP a (NP a) (S (VP a (VP r (NP r)))))) -- (VP didn't (VP have (NP the heart) (S (VP to
(VP tell (NP him)))))) -- have the heart to.

(VP r (PP a (NP a)) (PP a (NP r))) -- (VP was (PP in (NP love)) (PP with (NP that bunny))) -- in love with
(VP r (NP a) (PP a (NP r (NP r)))) -- (VP had (NP a good feeling) (PP for (NP that sort of (NP thing)))) -- a good feeling for

(VP a (PP a) (PP a (NP r)) *) -- (VP ran (PP away) (PP from (NP home)) (PP at (NP age two))) -- ran away from

(VP a (NP a) (PRT a) *) -- (VP get (NP it) (PRT out)) -- Let's get it out in the open.

(S (VP a (NP a))) -- (VP was (NP (NP a man) (SBAR (WHNP who) (S (VP broke (NP the law)))))) -- broke the law.


Idioms:
That is a hard act to follow.
