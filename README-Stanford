             Stanford Parser Compatibility Mode
             ----------------------------------
                      October 2009

The Stanford parser provides a defacto standard defintion of dependency
relations used in parsing.  Relex has a prototype compatibility feature,
which attempts to generate the same output as the Stanford parser.
This is an interesting thing to do, for two reasons:

   1) It provides a way of double-checking parse results,
   2) Preliminary tests show that RelEx is more than three
      times faster than the Stanford parser.

The compatibility mode is currently experimental and incomplete.
It can be enabled with the --stanford flag, passed to
RelationExtractor.java
