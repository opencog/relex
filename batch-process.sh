# batch-process.sh: Example batch processing script. Unlike the other
# examples, this script outputs the so-called "compact format" which
# captures the full range of Link Grammar and RelEx output in a format
# that can be easily post-processed by other systems (typically by
# using regex's). The src/perl/cff-to-opencog.pl perl script provides
# an example of post-processing: it converts this output format into
# OpenCog hypergraphs.
#
# The idea behind the batch processing is that it is costly to parse
# large quantities of text: thus, it is convenient to parse the text
# once, save the results, and then perform post-processing at liesure,
# as needed.  Thus, the form of post-processing can be changed at will,
# without requiring texts to be re-processed over and over again.
