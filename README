                  OpenRelEx Semantic Relation Extractor
                  -------------------------------------

RelEx is a syntactic relationship extractor; it will parse
English language sentences and return the  relationships
between different parts of the sentence.

There are two parts: the command-line version, and an
graphical visualizer. Build and install for the command 
line version is discussed first.

Dependencies
-------------
The following packages are required to be installed:
 - libgetopt-java
 - LinkParser
 - Wordnet 2.0 or later
 - JWNL Java wordnet library
 - OpenNLP tools
 - GATE 4.0 or later (optional)

Building command-line RelEx
---------------------------

- Link Grammar Parser
 X  XXX the sentences below are wrong, version 4.3.5 or later is needed.
X	Ubunut/Debian users can install the linkparser with apt-get:
X
X		apt-get install liblink-grammar4 link-grammar-dictionaries-en
X
 X  XXX the sentences above are wrong, version 4.3.5 or later is needed.

	Other users:
	Compile and install the Link Grammar Parser. This parser is
	described at http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/, and sources
	are available for download at
	http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/#download

	The Link Grammar Parser is the underlying engine, providing
	the core sentence parsing ability.

	If the link-grammar is installed in an unusual location,
	be sure to modify -Djava.library.path appropriately in 
	relation-extractor.sh.

- Wordnet
	Wordnet is used by RelEx to provide basic English morphology,
	such as singular versions of (plural) nouns, base forms (lemmas)
	of adjectives, adverbs and infinitve forms of verbs.

	Download, unpack and install WordNet 2.0.  The install directory
	then needs to be specified in data/wordnet/file_properties-linux.xml,
	with the name="dictionary_path" property in this file.

	Some typical install locations are:
	/opt/WordNet-2.0/data for RedHat and SuSE
	/usr/share/wordnet for Ubuntu and Debian
	C:\Program Files\WordNet\2.0\data for Windows

	The relex/Morphy/Morphy.java class provides a simple, easy-to-use
	wrapper around wordnet, providing the needed word morphology info.

- didion.jwnl
	The didion JWNL is the "Java WordNet Libary", and provides the
	Java programming API to access the wordnet data files.
	Its home page is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet
	and can be downloaded from
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=33824	

	Verify that the final installed location of jwnl.jar is correctly
	specified in the build.xml file. Note that GATE (below) also
	provides a jwnl.jar, but the GATE version of jwnl.jar is not
	compatible (welcome to java DLL hell).

	RelEx works with jwnl-1.3.3 but problems have been reported
	with jwnl-1.4-rc1. 

- GATE
	GATE, the "General Architecture for Text Engineering", 
	http://www.gate.ac.uk/ provides a large framework which
	RelEx does not use. However, it does provide a good entity
	detector, which RelEx does employ. "Entities" are the 
	names of people, corporations and institutions, as well 
	as time, date and money expressions. Factoring these out
	explicitly makes parsing and relation extraction simpler.

	Download GATE 4.0 from http://gate.ac.uk/download/index.html

	Install it at /opt/GATE-4.0 . If you change this location,
	please modify the system property -Dgate.home=/opt/GATE-4.0
	in relation-extractor.sh.  Modify build.xml to point at the
	correct location of gate-4.0.jar.

	GATE also requires the installation of the Xerces XML parser.
	Debian/Ubuntu users can install Xerces using apt, via
	"apt-get install libxerces2-java"

	Other users may need to get xerces from 
	http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/

	GATE is used solely to perform entity resolution; that is, 
	to determine substrings that correspond to names, dates, 
	addresses, money amounts, etc. The use of GATE is optional,
	however, without it, the parser has trouble with dates, 
	money amounts etc. GATE is also needed to identify the gender
	(male, female) of people names; the gender is needed for 
	anaphora resolution (so that "she" is matched nly to female 
	names).

	Alternatives to GATE may be used by providing a replacement
	for the relex/corpus/GateEntityMaintainer.java file.

- OpenNLP
	OpenNLP provides a number of natural language processing tools.
	RelEx uses OpenNLP for sentence detection, giving RelEx the
	ability to input texts containing multiple sentences.

	The OpenNLP home page is at http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
	Download and install OpenNLP tools, and verify that the 
	installed files are correctly identified in both build.xml
	and in relation-extractor.sh.

	OpenNLP also requires the installation of maxent from
	http://maxent.sourceforge.net/  It appears that both maxent-2.4.0.jar
	and maxent-2.4.0.jar work fine with RelEx.
	
	The OpenNLP package is used solely in corpus/DocSplitter.java,
	which provides a simple, easy-to-use wrapper for splitting a
	document into sentences. Replace this file if an alternate
	sentence detector is desired.

- Trove
	Some users may require GNU Trove to run RelEx, although this may
	depend on the JDK installed.  GNU Trove is an implementation of 
	the java.util class heirarchy, which may or may not be included
	in the installed JDK.  If needed, download trove from:

	http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/

	Using trove may improve performance and/or decrease memory
	usage, as compared to the standard JDK implementation of 
	the java.util heirarchy.

- GraphViz
	XXX current distro does not use graphviz; ignore the following.

	GraphViz is needed to generate dependency relation graphs.
	These are output as PNG graphics files, illustrating the
	parsed sentence.

	GraphViz is installable as an Ubuntu package; rpms are available
	for Fedora and other distros. If needed, source can be downloaded
	from http://www.graphviz.org/ If installing from source, be sure
	that the executables (dot, neato, fdp, twopi, circo) are in the
	system path. The manner in whcih they are called can be modified
	by referring to the Java class relex.uima.RelexEngine

	The default viewer for PNG images when running RelexEngine from
	the command-line is eog ("Eye of Gnome"). 

	XXX current distro does not use graphviz; ignore the above.

Building
--------
	After the above are installed, the relex java code can be built.
	The build system uses "ant", and the ant build specifictions
	are in "build.xml". Simply saying "ant" at the command line
	should be enough to build.


Running Relex
-------------
Several example shell scripts (MS Windows batch files) are included
to show sample usage. These files (*.sh in unix, or *.bat, in Windows)
define the required system properties, classpath and JVM options.

If there are any ClassNotFound exceptions, please verify the paths
and values in these files.  An important property is relex.algpath;
it defines the semantic algorithms used by RelEx.  The default file
is data/relex-semantic-algs.txt.

1) Simple single-sentence parser
	The "relation-extractor.sh" file is a simple shell script illustrating
	the parse of single sentence.  Shows typical RelEx raw output.

	Dependencies:
	- relex.parser.LinkParserJNINewClient: liblink-grammar.so,
	  liblink-grammar-java.so, and the linkparser data files 
	  (by default, in /usr/share/link-grammar/data/)
	- relex.morphy.Morphy: jwnl.jar, commons-logging.jar, WordNet
	  data files (external)

2) Relex Engine 

	The relex engine is the main entry point for the system.
	It is invoked from the command line by running "relex-engine.sh". It
	will accept sentences from the command-line, and display:
	- The link parser output
	- The detected persons, organizations and locations
	- The dependency relations found. The number after each relation is the
	  number of parses where the relation was found.
	- The raw relex output (the same produced by relation-extractor)
	- Optionally, a dependency relation graph (in the PNG format)


TODO
----
The Java install dependencies would be much easier to deal with if
there was a centralized repository from which one could easily obtain
the needed jar files. That is, something analogous to apt-get or CPAN.
The closest such thing for Java is "maven"; however, none of the jar
files required by relex have been checked into maven. Thus, a to-do:
get all of the jar files submitted to maven.
