;  Known issues:
;  1.   Passive is not handled correctly.  "This is the cup that John gave me."
;       We need a non-template alg to handle passive ditransitive verbs.
;       Also "This is the cup that John was given."
;  2. Special O*i construction: It is Jane who wants to do it.
;  3. VERB_INF / PAST PART alg?
;  4. R exception for "even" and "only"
;  5. NP subjects with predeterminers are not handled correctly.
;     Specifically, "All the boys are here" needs to identify "boys"
;     as subject, not "all". Instead, link-grammar treats "all" as the 
;     subject, and "boys" as the prepositional object. Which is .. curious.
;     Anyway, this is not how the stanford parser does it ...

; Currently, RelEx tags all negative assertions as hypothetical; for
; example: “John wasn't there” or “that isn't the case”. The linguistic
; reasoning to support this is not well-grounded, but is based on the
; notion that such negative assertions are generated as replies to
; speculative questions, and thus are inherently argumentative, inheriting
; the speculative nature of the question. A proper study, based on corpus
; linguistics principles, might clarify whether such tagging is indeed
; semantically appropriate. More importantly, this case illustrates the
; limits of a purely syntactic approach to identification of
; speculative/hypothetical statements. The speculative nature of the
; sentence is no longer readily appearent from its grammatical
; construction; the context of the surrounding paragraphs or dialog
; provides a semantic backdrop that is necessary to properly interpret the
; remark.
